    Calculate the MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 digests of a local file.

    The file is read incrementally in fixed-size chunks so that memory
    usage stays constant regardless of file size. This makes the function
    safe for very large files, including those larger than 2 GB, without
    ever loading the whole file into memory.
